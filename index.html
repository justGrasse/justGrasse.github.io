	<p>RawwwRRR!!! Although everyone knows of the legendary Snowperson, the Yeti, very few know of the richness of the lore that surrounds him [or her, I mean it's the 21st Century after all].  This lore has long been frozen in time, but as Western culture begins to adopt the beauty and horrors of this cryptic creature on the big screen and in written word, the ice thaws.  It's time to take a good look at who the Yeti truly is and embrace its story justly.  And there is no better place to start than... <b>The Yeti Gazetti!</b></p>

			<aside>MINOR WEB-TANGENT: This site does a great job of sectioning three columns to separate the internal links, the body, and the external links.  However, the site lacks a good amount of detail and semantics. For example, the images are included without many attributes to describe the image or to display text if the image fails to load. Semantically, it would benefit the developer to enclose the image with a &lt;figure&gt; tag and include captions using &lt;figcaption&gt; tags.</aside>
